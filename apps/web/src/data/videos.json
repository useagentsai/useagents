Watch as he transforms the massive Stripe API (600+ endpoints) into focused, usable tool sets that AI agents can actually work with effectively. Learn about the sweet spot for tool count and best practices, how to improve tool descriptions for better agent understanding, and see a powerful demo of cross-API workflows that combine HubSpot, Stripe, and Speakeasy APIs into a single business process solution. Perfect for developers looking to build practical AI agents that can handle real-world business tasks.",
