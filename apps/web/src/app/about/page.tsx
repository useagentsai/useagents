            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              nt3 is the open marketplace for AI builders. We believe that
              building powerful AI applications shouldn't require spending
              countless hours researching and evaluating tools. Our mission is
              to make AI development more accessible by curating the best
              frameworks, SDKs, LLMs, and infrastructure tools in one place.
